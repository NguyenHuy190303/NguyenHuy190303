### üöÄ AI-Driven and Big Data Projects
Here‚Äôs a glimpse into some of my projects where I combine AI technologies with large-scale data processing frameworks like **Apache Spark** and **Apache Hadoop**:

- **[Images-Retrieval-Streamlit](https://github.com/NguyenHuy190303/Images-Retrieval-Streamlit)**: A high-performance image retrieval system inspired by Google Image Search, leveraging **Computer Vision** techniques for efficient image-based queries on e-commerce platforms like Shopee, Lazada, and Tiki.
- **[LLM-PDF-QA](https://github.com/NguyenHuy190303/LLM-PDF-QA)**: A **Question Answering system** that applies **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to extract and analyze information from PDF documents, providing robust insights through **natural language understanding**.
- **[Mental-Care-AI](https://github.com/NguyenHuy190303/Mental-Care-AI)**: This project utilizes **LLMs** within the **LlamaIndex framework** to provide real-time psychological support, diagnose mental health conditions, and track progress over time with personalized feedback.
- **[YOLO-Project](https://github.com/NguyenHuy190303/YOLO-Project)**: An application of **YOLOv10** in **Computer Vision** for ensuring worker safety by detecting the presence of helmets in industrial environments.
- **[Big Data Processing with Apache Spark](https://github.com/NguyenHuy190303/Big-Data-Processing)**: Leveraging **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing and **Apache Hadoop** for managing and storing large datasets, this project showcases efficient batch and real-time processing for big data analysis.

### üß† Expertise in Big Data Processing
In addition to my work in AI, I have a strong background in **Big Data processing** with extensive experience using **Apache Spark** and **Apache Hadoop** to handle massive datasets:

- **Apache Spark**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, known for its speed and efficiency in handling both **batch** and **stream processing** workloads.
- **Apache Hadoop**: A framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers using simple programming models, commonly used for managing and analyzing big data.
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: A highly fault-tolerant system that provides high throughput access to data, capable of scaling out across multiple nodes in a cluster.
- **MapReduce**: A key component of Hadoop, used for parallel data processing on large datasets, breaking tasks into smaller sub-tasks distributed across the cluster.
